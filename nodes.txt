The variable stimnode is the absolute reference from node 0 (that is, dend[0]) the topology of the fiber goes dend[0-4],soma[0],axon[0-20], so make sure the node you pick falls between numbers [0-27]

For Lauren, your fibers goes soma[0],axon[0-20], so make sure the node you pick falls between numbers [0-22]

Stimulate at these nodes (add more if you think it's necessary)
dend[0]
dend[2]
soma[0]
axon[0]
axon[10]
axon[20]

Record at these nodes:
dend[0]
dend[2]
soma[0]
axon[0]
axon[10]
axon[20]
